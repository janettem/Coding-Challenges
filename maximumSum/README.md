## Explanation
Given a sequence of integers, take a continuous chunk of it, so that the sum of its elements is maximized. You only need to return the maximum sum. For example, if you are given the sequence {3, -10, 4, -1, 2, 3, 6, -7}, you get the maximum sum by taking the elements {4, -1, 2, 3, 6} which sum up to 14.

## Usage
