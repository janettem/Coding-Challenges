### Language
C++

### Explanation
The Connell sequence can be represented as a growing series of numbered lines. The line number is the quantity of the numbers in the line and the square of the last number of the line. The numbers in the line increase by two. Given a start line, an end line, and a number, implement a function that returns the index of the number in the generated portion of the Connell sequence. If the number is not found, return -1.

### Language
C++

### Explanation
Tap code is a way to communicate messages via a series of taps for each letter in the message. Letters are arranged in a 5x5 polybius square, with the letter "k" being moved to the space with "c". Each letter is translated by tapping out the row and column number that the letter appears in, leaving a short pause in-between. Write a function that returns the tap code if given a word, or returns the translated word if given the tap code.
